In order to get the data for the model, you must 
1) Open the LeakyBucket.m file in Matlab and run it:

>> LeakyBucket

It will output a bunch of text files that will be 
needed to be able to produce the latex output.

2) The second step is to produce the latex output, 
using a syntax similar to:

$ pdflatex LeakyBucket.m

This will produce the .pdf file for the full 
report.
